# Image Search App Using React

This project is built using Vite which is a popular alternative to `create-react-app`.

By building this app, I learned:
- How to build an application using Unsplash API in React
- How to make API Calls in different scenarios
- How to use `useCallback` hook to avoid function re-creation
- How to use ESLint to fix application issues
- How to Implement Pagination in React

## Project Setup

1. Clone the Repository to your local machine using ZIP File or using the following git command:
```
git clone https://github.com/aniru-dh21/Image_Search.git
```

2. Install the dependencies using `npm`:
```
npm install
```

3. Run the command to access the application:
```
npm run dev
```

4. Access the application by navigating to <ins>http://127.0.0.1:5173/</ins>

## How to Get Access to the Unsplash API

- Now, to implement the image search, we need to get the API key from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash Website</a>.

- Navigate to <a href="https://unsplash.com/developers">this URL</a>, and click on the "Register as a developer" button displayed at the top right corner of the page.
